## Hi there 👋 I'm Bishnu Khadka. 

🔭 I’m currently working on Tabular Deep Learning — exploring how (or if) deep neural networks can outperform traditional models on tabular data.

I read this a while ago and it stuck with me: *“If you love your work, the work will love you back.”* I’m not sure if it’s always true, I’m not sure if that’s always true — but I’m here to find out.
